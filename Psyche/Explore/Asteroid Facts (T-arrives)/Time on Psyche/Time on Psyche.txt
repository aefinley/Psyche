Time on Psyche:

A day on Psyche is about 4 hours and 12 minutes.(7)
	This is the sidereal rotation period, or the "amount of time it takes for a [body] to completely spin around and make one full rotation." (8)
	You could live through just under six “days” on Psyche in the same time as one day on Earth!

A year on Psyche lasts about five Earth years (about 1,828 Earth days).(9)

Appearance:

Scientists have combined radar and optical observations to generate a 3D shape model of Psyche.(12) This model:
	Shows evidence for two crater-like depressions.
	Suggests that there is significant variation in the metal content and color of the asteroid over the surface.
	NOTE: No one has seen the Psyche asteroid yet, so we will not know what it actually looks like until the spacecraft arrives.

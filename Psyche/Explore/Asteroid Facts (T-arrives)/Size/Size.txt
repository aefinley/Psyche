Size:

As asteroids go, Psyche is relatively large and has an irregular shape:
	279 x 232 x 189 kilometers (173 x 144 x 117 miles).(11)
	If Psyche were a perfect sphere, it would have a diameter of 226 kilometers (140 miles):
		That is about the length of the state of Massachusetts (leaving out Cape Cod); If it were in Arizona it would stretch between Phoenix and Flagstaff!
		A surface area of about 641,800 square kilometers (246,300 square miles), making it just smaller than the area of the state of Texas and quite a bit larger than the area of California.

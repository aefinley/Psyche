Where:

Psyche lies in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

Psyche orbits the Sun at an average distance of 3 astronomical units (AU) (about 280 million miles); Earth orbits at 1 AU (about 93 million miles).
	Fun fact: Because Psyche and Earth orbit at different speeds, the distance from Earth to Psyche varies over a large range! From < 2 AU to > 4 AU.

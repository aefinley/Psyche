The Team:

Principal Investigator (PI): Lindy Elkins-Tanton, Arizona State University (ASU)

	The PI is responsible for overall mission success, and for the scientific integrity and execution of the mission within committed cost and schedule.
	The PI oversees the team organization, decides science priorities and progress, and oversees delivery of mission data to NASA’s Planetary Data System.
	The PI is the decision-maker within the Psyche team, and NASA is the ultimate decision-maker.
	The PI is responsible for ensuring that all mission participants are playing their roles as defined by the Team Guidelines.

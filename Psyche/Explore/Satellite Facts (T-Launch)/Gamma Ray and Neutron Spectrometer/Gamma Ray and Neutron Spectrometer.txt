Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer:

Will detect, measure, and map Psyche’s elemental composition.

Mounted on a 2-meter (6-foot) boom (“arm”) to:
	distance the sensors from background radiation created by energetic particles interacting with the spacecraft;
	provide an unobstructed field of view.

The team is based at the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University.

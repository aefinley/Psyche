Propulsion: Solar-electric (low thrust) propulsion

Solar electric propulsion uses electricity from solar arrays to create
electromagnetic fields to accelerate and expel charged atoms (ions) of xenon
to create a very low thrust with a very efficient use of propellant (1)

This will be the first use of Hall effect thrusters beyond lunar orbit.

The Psyche spacecraft is using xenon:
	Xenon is a gas that is in the air we breathe (in very small amounts-- 0.09 parts per million! (2))	
	Xenon gas is used in high quality light bulbs, including automobile headlamps and movie projectors.
	“The most common propellant used in ion propulsion is xenon, which is easily ionized and has a high atomic mass, thus generating a desirable level of thrust when ions are accelerated. It also is inert and has a high storage density; therefore, it is well suited for storing on spacecraft.” (3)

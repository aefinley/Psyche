Deep Space Optical Communication (DSOC):

The Psyche mission will test a sophisticated new laser communication technology that encodes data in photons (rather than radio waves) to communicate between a probe in deep space and Earth.

Using light instead of radio allows the spacecraft to communicate more data in a given amount of time.

The DSOC team is based at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

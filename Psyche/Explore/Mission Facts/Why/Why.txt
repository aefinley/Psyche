Why:

The asteroid Psyche may be able to tell us how Earth’s core and the cores of the other terrestrial (rocky) planets came to be. (The terrestrial planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.)
	
We can never go to the Earth’s core:
	Earth’s core lies at 3,000 kilometers (more than 1,800 miles) depth but we have only drilled to 12 kilometers (~7.5 miles) – that’s the most our technology allows today.
	Earth’s core lies at about 3 million times the pressure of the atmosphere
	The temperature of Earth’s core is about 5,000 Celsius (~9,000 Fahrenheit)

Because we cannot see or measure Earth’s core directly, asteroid Psyche offers a unique window into the violent history of collisions and accretion that created the terrestrial planets.

It is the only known place in our solar system where we can examine directly what is almost certainly a metallic core of an early planet.

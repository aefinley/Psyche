Goals:

Understand a previously unexplored building block of planet formation: iron cores. â€¨
Look inside terrestrial planets, including Earth, by directly examining the interior of a differentiated body, which otherwise could not be seen.

Explore a new type of world. For the first time, examine a world made not of rock and ice, but metal.
